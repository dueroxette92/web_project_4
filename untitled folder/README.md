# Project 4: Around The U.S.
Project Page: https://dueroxette92.github.io/web_project_4/index.html

### Overview
In this project, is quiet really different that the previous project. This time, I am not only linking my css file but also linking my javascript file. 
* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SurN1jaeEQIhuZEDMhmWWf/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!
